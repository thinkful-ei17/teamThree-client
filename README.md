#Project Description
Centible is an investment learning tool, which allows users to experiment with investing in low to high risk funds.  Users learn how a mix of stocks and bonds define a strategy as low, moderate or high.  Based on this information, users select an investment strategy for year 1 through 5 and are able to see how their investments (gain/losses) compare with real market data over the same period.  Throughout the application, users are provided with textual descriptions and graphs which depict their investment selections and resulting data.
